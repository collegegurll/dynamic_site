<p> This chair includes cup holders, a built in remote control, 3d glasses, cgame controller, and an outlet plug. Some people may say this is a lazy invention, but there are people, in fact many people that would love to purchase a chair of their own. The tricky part about this individual chair is that it appears to look like a regular chair at first sight. You would have to pull the arms of the chair open in order to see the included products below.

<p>Instead of having to get up out of your seat to change the channel, wishing you had 3d glasses to watch your favorite action movie, needing to charge your phone while seated, and getting up to find your game controller, you can do all of those things while sitting in this chair, watching your favorite television show, movie, or even playing your favorite video game.</p>

<p> Our chairs come in different sizes and styles. We have chairs made for kids,teenagers, adults, and elderly. We also have a variety of colors. If you want to have your chair personally designed, we can do that as well. Recently added, is our King Size chairs, which has a little bit more spave than the normal sized chairs. </p>
